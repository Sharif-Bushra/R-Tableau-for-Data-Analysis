# R-Tableau-for-Data-Analysis
Using R and Tableau to analyze and visualize insights


I have recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate offered on Coursera. 
The course divides data analysis process into six stages (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, & act).
In the last course of the certificate, I have completed my Capstone Project on the Cyclistic Case Study, where I applied the six stages of data analysis to gather insights from a large amount of data.


Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company in Chicago. Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

My Role in this scenario is to analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends and answer the business question of: 
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

I cleaned and analyzed the data using R, and I used Tableau to create insightful visualizations.
